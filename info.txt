// One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
// There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.

// • The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
// While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
// while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
// and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.

// • There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.

// • Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
// philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.

// • When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
// start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
// a philosopher dies of starvation.

// • Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.

// • Philosophers don’t speak with each other.

// • Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.

// • No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!

// args: number_of_philosophers, time_to_die, time_to_eat, time_to_sleep, (all in milliseconds) optional: number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat

// As many forks as there are philos. One philo needs two forks to eat.
